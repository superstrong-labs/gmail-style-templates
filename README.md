Gmail-Style Templates
--------------
**Send emails that look like plain-old Gmail messages.**

These templates make it easy to send campaigns that look like plain emails sent via Gmail.

 - At a minimum, change the hardcoded "[COMPANY NAME]" in the footer.
 - You can also write your own unsubscribe text.

 For the shady among you thinking "I'll just remove the unsubscribe link" or "I'll just make the footer text white", doing so puts you at risk of violating CAN-SPAM, or at least swift punishment from your email provider.
